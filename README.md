# Hangman
A text-based version of the classic game, Hangman.

The computer chooses a word (5-12 charaters). To win, guess all letters in the word. If you guess incorrectly 5 times, you lose and the game is over.

## TODOs
- Finish test coverage
- Add a "Kid version" early-readers version (i.e. a library of words my friend's kids come up with)
- Add validation/error handling for bad input (multiple letters, guessing a number instead of a letter, guessing an already guessed letter...)
