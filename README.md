# Hangman
A text-based version of the classic game, Hangman to play in your terminal.

The computer chooses a word (5-12 charaters). To win, guess all letters in the word. If you guess incorrectly 5 times, you lose and the game is over.

## Setup
This game was written in Ruby and you'll need Ruby to play if you do not have it. 
1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:kellyky/hangman.git`
2. cd into this repo `cd hangman`

## Gameplay
You play the game in your terminal. 

To play:
```
ruby play_hangman.rb
```

## TODOs
- Add a "Kid version" early-readers version (i.e. a library of words my friend's kids come up with)
- Add feature that allows player to save game and play again later.
